        <h1>Happy 10th Monthsary, My Love! ðŸ’œ</h1>
        <p>Hi loveee. Happy 10th monthsary. Ang tagaaal na natin. We've been through a lot of problems and here we are, we're still together. Loveee, there are so many changes that I noticed in our relationship as time passed by. I noticed that both of us are slowly growing. Or should I say that I am the only one that is maturing here because in the first place you're already matured. You made me matured. You made me learn so many things that I need for me to grow. Loveee, kanina, nagtatampo talaga ako sa'yooo. Nagtatampo ako sa'yo I'mkase I also noticed changes not only in our relationship but also in you. Napansin ko na you've been very busy this past few days, that you even forget to talk to me. Lovee, inisip ko kanina na nawawalan ka na ng oras sa'kin, sa'tin. Sabi mo dati no'ng nasa bh pa ako na ako 'yong mawawalan ng time sa'yo kase nandito na mga pamangkin ko, na sa kanila na 'yong atensiyon ko pero hindi naman eh kase gumagawa naman ako ng time para sa'tin 'di ba? 
</p>
<p>Loveee, gusto kong magalit sa'yo pero I don't have the rights kase dati Ikaw naghihintay sa'kin eh. But anyways, nawala 'yong tampo ko when you told me the reason why you've been like that, and I understand that we have our own responsibilities that we need to do first. But mahaaal, just please let me know kung ano 'yong mga ginagawa mo, just please update me kase kanina pa 'ko naghihintay rito. Hindi naman mahirap mag-update mahaal 'di ba? Sana naman hindi na 'yon maulit, mahaaal. Btw, I miss youu so much. Mahal na mahaal kita, mahaaal ko. Sobraaaa. I want you to know that I'm so lucky to have you in my life, mahaal. I'm so lucky that I have a partner that I can run on to whenever I want to rant something. I'm so lucky to have you because you're always there for me through my ups and downs. Thank you for always being there, mahaaaal. Thank you for making me grow and thank you for being the best partner ever. You're the best, mahaal ko. I'm always proud of youuu. Btw, I'm sorry love if there are things that I made that hurt you a lot. I'm sorry kung makulit ako ah? I'm really sorry to have an attitude that annoys you. Mahaaal gusto ko ako lang, gusto ko ako lang mahaaal moo. Selfish man 'to pero ayokong mapunta ka sa iba, mahaaal. Sa'yo ko lang naramdaman 'yong ganitong pagmamahal. </p>
<p>Loveee, pleaseee, 'wag mo 'kong iiwan ah? I love you so much, my loveeee. I really do, that I am willing to do anything/everything for you. I want to spend my life with you. I want to marry you, mahaaaal ko. Can't wait to be your wife, to live with you, mahaaal ko. Can't wait na makita kong ikaw agad ang bungad paggising ko ng umaga. Can't wait to live with you forever, my wife. I love you always. Mahal na mahal kita, mahaal ko. Sobraaaa. Happy monthsary ulit. Mwaaaapss. Ehhh, I love you is really not enough to express how much I love you, mahaaaal ko. Mas lalo kitang minamahal sa araw-araw. Lalong nadaragdagan 'yong pagmamahal na nararamdaman ko sa'yo. Mahal pa kita sa mahaaaal, mahaal kooo. I really want to be with you na talaga. Gusto ko ng magsama tayo, 'yong panghabang buhay naaa. Kapag talaga ako nagkatrabaho, sa'yo na talaga ako uuwi. I love you so much, wifey. Mwaaaapsss.</p>
