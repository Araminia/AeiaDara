        <h1>Happy 1st Anniversary, love! ðŸ’œ</h1>
        <p>Hi, loveeee. Good morning, the long wait is oveeer because here we are now. It's our first anniversary. I didn't expect that we made it through this because of all the fights, the arguments, and the misunderstandings that have had happened, we still manage to become together up until now. This is it, I hope you don't get tired of reading my lsm because this is the only way that I can express how much I love you and how much I'm longing for you. Let's start on the first day that we met. Look, I still remember the day that I'm finding someone whom I can talk to because of sadness. The day or the minute before I met you, I already talk to some people at litmatch and I didn't even find someone na maayos kausap That time, I decided to stop using litmatch na kase napapagod na 'ko kumausap or humanap ng tao na makakausap ko ng maayos. But, there's something in me saying na magtry pa ng isa, so I did kase nga I'm so desperate to find someone that I can talk to. And because of that, I found you.</p>
<p>At first, I feel excitement the first time I talk to you and at the same time confused on what's your real gender because you said that your a boy but the way you talk is not what's telling about you. But there's in me that I don't care on what's your real gender as long as I'm happy talking to you. And then, because I'm already comfortable talking to you, I insist to get your fb account. Ang arte mo pa no'n kase ayaw mo pang ibigay. Buti na lang talaga kase nakulit kitaaaa no'n kase kung hindi, hindi talaga kita tatantanan. You know what, mas lalo akong napalapit sa'yo no'ng sa messenger na tayo nag-uusap. Alam mo 'yong feeling na kapag uuwi ako sa bahay, kapag may problema ako, may nalalapitan na ako at may napagsasabihan na 'ko ng problema ko without any judgement. Remember the day na nagpapareto ako sa'yo at no'ng inaasar kita sa classmate ko, that wasn't really my intention because that time I just really want get your attention. And I can't deny na unti-unti na talaga akong nahuhulog sa'yo. Naaasar pa nga ako kapag sinasakyan mo 'yong pang-aasar ko sa'yo sa classmate ko eh. </p>
<p>Meron pang time na hindi tayo nagkausap, hindi ko na alam kung bakit nangyari 'yon, but to get your attention back, nimyday ko 'yong sarili to get your attention again and hoping na ichat mo 'koo. Hindi nga ako nagkamali sa pagday ng sarili ko kase nagreply ka sa story koo. Gandang-ganda ka pa nga no'n eh, HAHAHAHAHA. As time passed by, nagkaroon na ng malalim na ugnayan between us wherein I don't want to be just your friend instead I want to be your partner, I want to be your girlfriend. Naalala mo 'yon, walang nanligaw. Just a real feeling between us. Sinasabi mo pa nga no'n sa'kin na gusto mo may label na. Hindi mo 'ko no'n pinipilit pero narealize ko na gusto ko na rin ng label. Admit it or not tatlong beses mong sinabi 'yon na gusto mo ng label 'di ba? No'ng unang pagkakasabi mo pa lang no'n, alam ko na agad sagot ko. Oo na agad, pero kase nahihiya pa akong sabihin sa'yo 'yon eh kase naman 1 month pa lang tayo magkausap no'n ðŸ˜­. But because of what I really feel for you, nagsabi na rin ako sa'yo ng gusto ko na rin talaga ng label.</p>
<p>naging tayo na, naging maayos naman 'yong samahan natin kase nga hindi tayo pumapayag na hindi maayos agad 'yong problema. Naging open tayo at mas nakilala natin ang isa't-isa. Nakilala mo 'ko sa pagiging iyakin ko and sensitive ðŸ™„. Love, growing up with you was so good and at the same time was so fun. Look, I've learned a lot from you since I met you. I learned so many things that will make me grow as an individual.  I'm so lucky that I have a partner that's always by my side through my ups and down. Giving me advice and cheering me up. I'm so lucky that you change me from a girl to a woman. I love you so much, my loveee. Always remember that you're always be the best partner that I ever had and I'm willing to do all the things that will make you happy. Btw, I'm sorry for having an attitude that always make you mad, sorry sa pagiging makulit ko ah. Pero hindi dahil nagso-sorry ako sa'yo eh hindi na 'ko magiging makulit kase ito 'yong naging reason kung bakit umabot tayo sa ganito, hehe.</p>

<p>I'm also sorry for everything I've done that hurt you a lot. I'm sorry, my lovee. I love you so much, my love. I'm always here for you no matter what. I'm always be here 'til we achieve what we want in life. Let's make all our plans turn into reality, mahaaaal. Mahal na mahal kitaaaa, sobraaaa. Hinding-hindi kita ipagpapalit sa kahit na sino 'cause you're irreplaceable, walang makakapantay sa lahat ng ginagawa mo sa'kin and sa relationship natin. Hinding-hindi kita iiwan. Ikaw lang gusto kong makasama araw-araw at ikaw lang din ang pipiliin ko sa araw-araw. Can't wait na makasama ka at magawa 'yong mga bagay na pinaplano natin. Always remember that your worth it. I'm so proud of you, mahaaaal. Always take care of yourself ah? And don't you dare na humanap ng iba kase hindi ako papayag. Gusto ko ako lang gusto moooo, ok? I love you so much. Happy anniversary, mahal kooo. Mwaaaapsss.</p>
