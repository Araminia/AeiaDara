        <h1>Happy 32nd Monthsary, My Love! ðŸ’œ</h1>
        <p>Hi, love. I know youâ€™re probably tired of me being like this. But what can I do if thatâ€™s really what I feel? Believe me, Iâ€™ve been trying so hard to stop feeling this way, to keep it to myself, to ignore it, pero wala e, kusa talaga siyang lumalabas. I know youâ€™ve been patient with me so many times, and I can see youâ€™re getting tired of understanding me every time this happens.
</p>
<p> Iâ€™m sorry, sorry for having this kind of feeling, sorry if I canâ€™t hold it back. I can't promise that this is the last time na magiging ganito ako. But I'll try my best para hindi na 'ko makaramdam ng ganito
 </p>
<p>Btw, good morning, love,  and happy 32nd monthsary sa atin. Ang bilis ng panahon, no? Thirty-two months na tayong magkasama, and it still amazes me how far weâ€™ve come. Weâ€™ve been through a lot of ups and downs, misunderstandings, and small fights,  but here we are, still holding on, still choosing each other every single time.
</p>
<p> Love, thank you for everything. Thank you for always understanding me kahit minsan ang hirap kong intindihin. Thank you for listening whenever I need someone to talk to, and for making me feel that itâ€™s okay to be honest about my emotions. You never make me feel shallow or overreacting,  instead, you make me feel valid, appreciated, and heard. That means so much to me</p>
<p>Naalala ko noong OJT mo, ang dami nating pinagdaanan. There were days na pagod tayo, tahimik, minsan nagkakatampuhan pa, but still, we never gave up. We learned to adjust, to understand, and to support each other kahit mahirap. Those moments made me realize how strong our relationship really is.
</p>
<p> And now, habang tumatagal tayo, mas lalong lumalalim â€˜yong pagmamahal ko saâ€™yo. Hindi lang dahil sa mga ginagawa mo, kundi dahil sa kung paano mo ako pinaparamdam na mahalaga ako, hindi lang bilang partner. You bring out the best in me, and Iâ€™ll always be grateful for that.
</p>
<p> Thank you, love, for your effort, your patience, and for staying with me through everything. I know life will keep testing us, but Iâ€™m not scared, because I know weâ€™ll face it together. Alam kong kakayanin natin as long as we keep choosing to understand, to communicate, and to stay. What matters most is that we never stop trying, kasi â€˜yon naman talaga ang mahalaga, â€˜yong pareho nating pinipili ang isaâ€™t isa, no matter what. Thank you kasi alam ko na pagod ka na, pero nandiyan ka pa rin, nag-stay ka pa rin. Pilit pinapaintindi 'yong mga bagay na hindi ko naman dapat gawin. Thank you for being part of my growth. I'm so lucky to have you.</p>
